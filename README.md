- Try clearing npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`

---

#### 4️⃣ Environment Configuration

**For Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

**For Linux/Mac:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**Edit the `.env` file** with a text editor and configure your database:

```env
APP_NAME="IPCR System"
APP_ENV=local
APP_KEY=
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_TIMEZONE=Asia/Hong_Kong
APP_URL=http://localhost:8000

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=ipcr_system
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=

SESSION_DRIVER=database
```

**Generate Application Key:**

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

This will automatically add the APP_KEY to your .env file.

---

#### 5️⃣ Database Setup

**Option A: Using phpMyAdmin (Recommended for XAMPP users)**

1. Start XAMPP Control Panel
2. Start Apache and MySQL services
3. Open phpMyAdmin: http://localhost/phpmyadmin
4. Click "New" in the left sidebar
5. Database name: `ipcr_system`
6. Collation: `utf8mb4_unicode_ci`
7. Click "Create"

**Option B: Using MySQL Command Line**

```bash
# For XAMPP on Windows
C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysql.exe -u root -e "CREATE DATABASE ipcr_system CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;"

# For Linux/Mac
mysql -u root -e "CREATE DATABASE ipcr_system CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;"
```

**Run Migrations:**

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

This will create all necessary tables:
- users
- departments
- designations
- user_roles
- user_photos
- sessions
- cache
- migrations

---

#### 6️⃣ Storage Setup

Create the symbolic link for file storage:

**For Windows (PowerShell - Run as Administrator):**
```powershell
php artisan storage:link
```

**For Linux/Mac:**
```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

This creates a symbolic link from `public/storage` to `storage/app/public` for user photo uploads.

**If you encounter permission errors on Windows:**
- Right-click PowerShell/Command Prompt and select "Run as Administrator"
- Or manually create the folder: `mkdir storage\app\public\user_photos`

---

#### 7️⃣ Seed Database with Admin User

Run the database seeder:

```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

This will create:
- **3 Departments:** College of Accountancy (COA), College of Business (COB), College of Computer Studies (CCS)
- **4 Designations:** Professor, Associate Professor, Assistant Professor, Instructor
- **1 Admin User:** Administrator account

**Default Admin Credentials:**
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `password`
- **Employee ID:** `URS26-ADM00001`
- **Email:** `admin@ipcr.system`

**⚠️ Important:** This admin account is protected and cannot be edited or deleted through the UI.

---

#### 8️⃣ Create Logo Image Folder

**For Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
New-Item -Path "public/images" -ItemType Directory -Force
```

**For Linux/Mac:**
```bash
mkdir -p public/images
```

**Add your logo (Optional):**
- Place your logo image as `public/images/urs_logo.jpg`
- Recommended size: 100x100px or similar square/rectangular logo
- If no logo is provided, the system will work without it

---

#### 9️⃣ Build Frontend Assets

Before running the application, you must build the CSS and JavaScript assets:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command:
- Compiles all CSS and JavaScript files
- Optimizes and minifies assets for production
- Creates versioned files in `public/build/` directory
- Should take about 30 seconds to complete

**Important:** You must run this command at least once before starting the server, or assets won't load properly.

---

#### 🔟 Start the Laravel Development Server

**Navigate to the project directory** (very important!):

```bash
# Make sure you're in the IPCR folder, not the parent folder
cd C:\xampp\htdocs\IPCR  # Example for Windows
# OR
cd /path/to/IPCR  # Example for Linux/Mac
```

**Start the server:**

```bash
php artisan serve
```

**You should see:**
```
INFO  Server running on [http://127.0.0.1:8000].
Press Ctrl+C to stop the server
```

**Access the application:**
- Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:8000** or **http://127.0.0.1:8000**

**Common Issues:**

## 🛠️ Development

### Running the Application

**Production Mode (Recommended for normal use):**
```bash
# Build optimized assets (only need to run once or after code changes)
npm run build

# Start Laravel development server
php artisan serve
```
Access at: http://localhost:8000

**Development Mode with Hot Reload (For developers making changes):**

Open **two separate terminal windows**:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Vite dev server with hot reload
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Laravel development server
cd C:\xampp\htdocs\IPCR  # Navigate to project folder first
php artisan serve
```

**What's the difference?**
- `npm run build` - Builds assets once, optimized and minified for production
- `npm run dev` - Watches for file changes and auto-reloads browser (useful when editing CSS/JS)

### Running Tests

```bash
php artisan test
```

### Clearing Cache

If you encounter strange behavior or old data showing up:

```bash
# Clear all caches at once
php artisan optimize:clear

# Or clear individually
php artisan cache:clear      # Application cache
php artisan config:clear     # Configuration cache
php artisan route:clear      # Route cache
php artisan view:clear       # Compiled views cache
```

### Asset Management with Vite

```bash
# Development with hot module replacement (auto-refresh)
npm run dev

# Production build (optimized, minified, hashed)
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview
```

**Vite Features:**
- ⚡ Lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR)
- 📦 Optimized production builds with tree-shaking
- 🔄 Auto-refresh browser on file changes (with npm run dev)
- 🎯 Cache-busting with content hashes
- 📊 Build size analysis

### Database Management

**Reset database completely:**
```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```
⚠️ **Warning:** This deletes ALL data and recreates tables with fresh seed data

**Add new migration:**
```bash
php artisan make:migration create_something_table
```

**Rollback last migration:**
```bash
php artisan migrate:rollback
```

### Code Generation

```bash
# Create new controller
php artisan make:controller NameController

# Create new model
php artisan make:model ModelName

# Create model with migration
php artisan make:model ModelName -m

# Create new seeder
php artisan make:seeder NameSeeder
```
