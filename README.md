## 🔧 Troubleshooting

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

For detailed troubleshooting, see **[INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md)**

### Quick Fixes

```bash
# Clear all caches
php artisan optimize:clear

# Rebuild assets
npm run build

# Reset database (WARNING: deletes all data)
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

# Regenerate autoload
composer dump-autoload
```

---

## 🛠️ Development

### Running the Application

**Production Mode (Recommended for normal use):**
```bash
# Build optimized assets (only need to run once or after code changes)
npm run build

# Start Laravel development server
php artisan serve
```
Access at: http://localhost:8000

**Development Mode with Hot Reload (For developers making changes):**

Open **two separate terminal windows**:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Vite dev server with hot reload
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Laravel development server
cd C:\xampp\htdocs\IPCR  # Navigate to project folder first
php artisan serve
```

**What's the difference?**
- `npm run build` - Builds assets once, optimized and minified for production
- `npm run dev` - Watches for file changes and auto-reloads browser (useful when editing CSS/JS)

### Running Tests

```bash
php artisan test
```

### Clearing Cache

If you encounter strange behavior or old data showing up:

```bash
# Clear all caches at once
php artisan optimize:clear

# Or clear individually
php artisan cache:clear      # Application cache
php artisan config:clear     # Configuration cache
php artisan route:clear      # Route cache
php artisan view:clear       # Compiled views cache
```

### Asset Management with Vite

```bash
# Development with hot module replacement (auto-refresh)
npm run dev

# Production build (optimized, minified, hashed)
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview
```

**Vite Features:**
- ⚡ Lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR)
- 📦 Optimized production builds with tree-shaking
- 🔄 Auto-refresh browser on file changes (with npm run dev)
- 🎯 Cache-busting with content hashes
- 📊 Build size analysis

### Database Management

**Reset database completely:**
```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```
⚠️ **Warning:** This deletes ALL data and recreates tables with fresh seed data

**Add new migration:**
```bash
php artisan make:migration create_something_table
```

**Rollback last migration:**
```bash
php artisan migrate:rollback
```

### Code Generation

```bash
# Create new controller
php artisan make:controller NameController

# Create new model
php artisan make:model ModelName

# Create model with migration
php artisan make:model ModelName -m

# Create new seeder
php artisan make:seeder NameSeeder
```
